# TrainTicketSystem
A console-based Java application that allows users to book, cancel, and manage train tickets. Built with clean Object-Oriented Programming principles, this system provides a modular and testable architecture using services, DAOs, and models.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java 22** – Core programming language
- **Maven** – Project and dependency management
- **JUnit 5** – Unit testing framework
- **Mockito** – Mocking framework
- **MySQL** – Relational database
- **JDBC** – Java Database Connectivity
- **Lombok** – Boilerplate code reduction
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – Development environment


## Features

- User registration & login

- View available trains

- Book tickets

- Cancel bookings

- View booking history

- DAO-Service architecture

- Unit tested services using Mockito


## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
